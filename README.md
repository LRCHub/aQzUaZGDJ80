```lrc
[00:11.23] I'm alone here on my island, floating in the sky
[00:14.82] I'm high above the world I used to know
[00:17.87] And I'm far from any danger, safe from any failure
[00:21.42] Guarded, I found shelter in the storm
[00:39.92] 
[00:24.23] I'm hiding in the blue
[00:28.64] Safe between the clouds
[00:30.93] In the blue
[00:34.99] Where I can't be found
[00:45.99] 
[00:37.19] Was a soldier in the legions, fought against the demons
[00:40.69] Fought against the monsters made of gold
[00:43.56] But they stormed across Arcadia, following their nature
[00:46.96] Washed away the place I once called home
[01:06.96] 
[00:50.03] I'm hiding in the blue
[00:54.14] Safe between the clouds
[00:56.64] In the blue
[01:00.72] Where I can't be found
[01:03.07] I'm hiding in the blue
[01:14.07] 
[01:15.28] I'm hiding in the blue
[01:26.28] 
[01:28.40] As time goes racing by, I'm wishing I could be fine
[01:31.84] But I'm still so stuck on what used to be
[01:34.70] Made a prison out of my mind, watch life as it goes by
[01:38.27] Battle-scarred, my own worst enemy
[01:55.27] 
[01:41.16] I'm hiding in the blue
[01:45.27] Safe between the clouds
[01:47.77] In the blue
[01:51.53] Where I can't be found
[01:53.90] I'm hiding in the blue
[02:04.90] 
[02:06.43] I'm hiding in the blue
[02:17.43] 
[02:13.11] Hiding in the blue
[02:22.11] 
[02:21.02] The world's passing by, and I lost sense of time
[02:26.83] I've gone numb, I miss the days when we were making legends
[02:34.15] The days come and go, I'll wait through sun and snow
[02:39.44] For you to come and take me from this place and bring me home
[03:09.94] 
[02:45.31] In the blue
[02:49.46] Safe between the clouds
[02:51.78] In the blue
[02:55.66] Where I can't be found
[02:58.19] I'm hiding in the blue
[03:09.19] 
[03:10.67] Hiding in the blue
[03:17.55] In the blue
